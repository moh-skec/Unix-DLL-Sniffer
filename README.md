- I Wrote a program called DLL Sniffer that displays all the packets coming into your network card in hexadecimal.
Also, the type (Outgoing, Incoming, Broadcast, Multicast) is specified for each package.
- I expanded the previous program so that next to the packet type, the higher layer protocol type (IP or ARP) is also displayed, and I named this program DLL Sniffer 2.
- I developed program 2 so that if the upper layer protocol is IP, it prints the IP header length, the total IP packet length in bytes, and the protocol number above the IP header.
I named this program DLL Sniffer Pro.
